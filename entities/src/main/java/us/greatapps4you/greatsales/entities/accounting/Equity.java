/**
 * Equity refers to the amount of money invested in a business by its owners. It's also known as "owner's equity" and can include things of non-monetary value such as time, energy, and other resources. (Ever heard of "sweat equity"?)
 * Equity can also be defined as the difference between your business's assets (what you own) and liabilities (what you owe).
 * A business with healthy (positive) equity is attractive to potential investors, lenders, and buyers. Investors and analysts also look at your businessâ€™s EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

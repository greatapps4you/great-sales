/**
 * Cost of Goods Sold
 * The cost of goods sold (COGS) or cost of sales (COS) is the cost of producing your product or delivering your service.
 * COGS or COS is the first expense you’ll see on your profit and loss (P&L) statement and is a critical component when calculating your business’s gross margin. Reducing your COGS can help you increase profit without increasing sales.

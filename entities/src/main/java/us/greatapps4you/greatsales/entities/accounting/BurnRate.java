 * Your burn rate is how quickly your business spends money. Itâ€™s a critical component when calculating and managing your cash flow.
 * To calculate your burn rate, simply pick a time period (such as a quarter or a year). Subtract your on-hand cash amount at the end of that period from your on-hand cash at the beginning, then divide that number by the number of months in the period (or by your chosen cadence).

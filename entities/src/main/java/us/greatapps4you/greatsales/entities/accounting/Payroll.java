/**
 * Payroll For Employees
 * You can deduct employee wages (salaries and commission bonuses) employee education expenses, and employee benefits (accident and health plans, adoption assistance, life insurance, and more) from your taxes.
 * You can also deduct payroll taxes, which are employment taxes paid on behalf of your employees (like Social Security and Medicare as well as federal and state unemployment taxes).
 * Employees should submit a W-4 form so you know how much tax to withhold. In exchange, you should provide employees with a W-2 form, which summarizes their yearly gross pay. They use this to pay personal taxes.
 * Payroll For Independent Contractors
 * Independent contractors include freelancers, consultants, and other outsourced experts that aren't formally employed by your business. With contractors, you don't pay benefits or withhold taxes on their behalf.
 * Because of that, contractors should submit a W-9 form so you have their business information (such as their SSN or EIN), and you should provide a 1099-MISC form in exchange (if you pay them more than $600 per year).
 * A 1099 form tells the government how much you spent for their services â€” so you can write this amount on your tax return, and so they can assume the tax burden on their return.

        - Customer Identification and Address;
        - Delivery Date as well as delivery carrier;
        - Transportation fee and who pays that fee;

        - To whom the invoice must be mailed;
        - Commission in percentage and in currency;
        - Tax (ICMS) in percentage;

    When the Vendor is selected,
        - Its own form must be selected and filled with the Data I am entering.

    When the Order is sent,
        - The order must me emailed to the Vendor;
        - Bookkeeping entries for my sales man services must be 
          automatically recorded;
